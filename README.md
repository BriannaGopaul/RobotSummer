## Competition Outline
(in progress) 

In 6 weeks, we were tasked to build 2 autonomous robots that can play the game Overcooked, in real life. The goal of the competition is to earn the most points by making as many meal combinations as possible in 2 minutes. Each robot must be able to drive to ingredient areas, pick up individual ingredients and stack them to make burgers, salads and other meal combinations each worth a different amount of points. Finally, the robot must serve the meal on a plate at the serving area where an 1khz IR beacon is located.

Our strategy was to make the most burgers possible in 2 minutes. Our first robot is located on the top region of the competition surface. It's designed to pick up ingredients and place them on the cooking surface for the second robot to pick up. The second robot picks up ingredients and stacks them in a chute. This chute vertically aligns the ingredients to make burgers. Once all the ingredients have been placed in the chute, the robot dispenses the ingredients on a plate.
